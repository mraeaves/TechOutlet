# TechOutlet
This is a new project using ReactJS to create a new version of a previous college project

Feel free to check out the LIVE verison of this project over on https://tech-outlet.vercel.app/

# Task Outline
The task I was set within college, was to create, design and implement an e-commerce website. This website had to be functional to a point where items could be clicked and the site could be navigated around but we did not have to implement a working basket, checkout or payments.

# 1 - Design Images

# 2 - Implementation
